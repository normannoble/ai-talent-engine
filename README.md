# AI Talent Engine: Builder Framework for AI-Native Engineering

A talent management framework designed for AI-native product development organizations. Built on the principle that **AI tooling has fundamentally changed the economics of software development—the constraint is now judgment, not hands.**

---

## 🎯 The Paradigm Shift

### Traditional Model

Traditional product teams are built around **specialized roles**:

| Role | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Software Engineer | Writes code |
| Designer | Creates UI/UX |
| Product Manager | Defines what to build |
| Engineering Manager | Develops engineers |
| Delivery Lead | Ensures teams ship |

This model scales by adding specialists. A team of 8-10 people might have 5 engineers, 1 designer, 1 PM, 1 EM, and a shared delivery function. Coordination overhead grows with headcount.

### AI-Native Model

AI tooling changes the economics. A single person with strong judgment across multiple domains can now leverage AI to do work that previously required specialists. The constraint shifts from **hands to do the work** to **judgment to direct the AI**.

The Builder model replaces specialization with **capable generalists**:

| Traditional Roles | Replaced By |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Software Engineer | Builder (Technical Judgment + AI Orchestration) |
| Designer | Builder (Design Judgment) |
| Product Manager | Builder (Product Judgment + Commercial Awareness) |
| Engineering Manager | Master Builder (develops Builders) |
| Delivery Lead | Embedded in Builder accountability |

### Implications

- **Smaller teams, higher output:** 2-3 Builders can deliver what previously required 8-10 specialists
- **Generalists over specialists:** Breadth of judgment matters more than depth in one domain
- **Development model changes:** Apprentices learn all six capabilities, not a single discipline
- **The constraint is judgment:** You can only scale as fast as you can develop people with cross-domain judgment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Understanding the Model

1. **[AI-Native Engineering Model](frameworks/AI_Native_Engineering_Model.md)** – Start here for the philosophy
2. **[Six Capabilities](frameworks/Six_Capabilities.md)** – Understand what we're assessing
3. **[Traditional to Builder Mapping](frameworks/Traditional_to_Builder_Mapping.md)** – How existing roles translate

### Assessing Current Team

1. **[Six Capabilities Rubric](assessment/Six_Capabilities_Rubric.md)** – Evaluate individuals
2. Look for side hustles as a key signal of demonstrated breadth

### Hiring

1. **[Builder Interview Guide](hiring/Builder_Interview_Guide.md)** – Approach and philosophy
2. Use appropriate scorecard for the level you're hiring

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Three Tiers

| Role | Description | Development Responsibility |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Master Builder** | Exceptional across all capabilities. Owns architectural coherence. The constraint on scale. | Develops Builders |
| **Builder** | Strong in most capabilities. Executes autonomously with AI tools. Knows when to escalate. | Develops Apprentices |
| **Apprentice** | Developing judgment under direct guidance. Learning to evaluate AI output critically. | Learning |

### Six Capabilities

| Capability | What "Strong" Looks Like |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **Technical Judgment** | Sees architectural implications before they become problems. Knows when AI-generated code is fragile, inefficient, or wrong. |
| **Product Judgment** | Can prioritize ruthlessly. Knows what to cut. Understands user problems deeply enough to evaluate solutions. |
| **Design Judgment** | Recognizes good UX intuitively. Can critique and improve interfaces. Understands design as function, not decoration. |
| **AI Orchestration** | Knows how to decompose problems for AI. Writes effective prompts. Manages multi-agent workflows. |
| **System Thinking** | Sees connections and dependencies. Anticipates second-order effects across technical and business domains. |
| **Commercial Awareness** | Connects work to business value. Makes trade-offs with cost/value in mind. Doesn't gold-plate. |

### Key Insight

**The constraint is Master Builders, not headcount.** You can only scale as fast as you can develop or acquire people with judgment across all six capabilities.

## 🔄 Progression

### Apprentice → Builder
**Criteria:** Demonstrated autonomy—consistently produces good output without supervision across most capabilities.

### Builder → Master Builder
**Criteria:** Demonstrated ability to develop Apprentices into Builders + architectural ownership across products.

## 📊 Assessment Signals

### Strong Indicators for Builder Potential

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Side hustle** | Forced to operate across all capabilities. Strong indicator of breadth. |
| **How they talk about trade-offs** | Do they see nuance, or is everything black/white? |
| **What they do when stuck** | Do they escalate appropriately? Do they reach for AI tools? |
| **Response to "why are we building this?"** | Product/commercial awareness shows here. |
| **How they handle feedback on non-code work** | Design/product judgment revealed in receptiveness. |
