# Six Capabilities Rubric

A framework for assessing individuals against the Builder model's six capabilities.

---

## Rating Scale

| Rating | Label | Definition |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **3** | Strong | Consistently demonstrates this capability. Could teach others. Makes sound judgments reliably. |
| **2** | Developing | Shows this capability in familiar contexts. Gaps under pressure or in new territory. Growing. |
| **1** | Weak | Rarely demonstrates. Significant development needed. Critical gap for autonomous work. |
| **?** | Unknown | Haven't observed. Need to probe further before rating. |

## Capability Assessment

### 1. Technical Judgment

**What we're assessing:** The ability to make sound decisions about how software should be built.

| Rating | Indicators |
|--------|-----------|
| **3 - Strong** | Catches architectural problems before they become issues. Knows when AI-generated code is problematic. Makes trade-offs appropriate to context. Decisions prove sound over time. Could explain rationale to others. |
| **2 - Developing** | Makes sound decisions in familiar contexts. Sometimes misses edge cases or long-term implications. Can evaluate AI output but occasionally accepts problematic code. Needs guidance on unfamiliar patterns. |
| **1 - Weak** | Accepts AI output without critical evaluation. Makes decisions that create problems downstream. Doesn't see trade-offs or always chooses the same option. Struggles to debug or understand system behavior. |

**Probe questions:**
- "Walk me through a technical decision you made recently. What trade-offs did you consider?"
- "How do you evaluate whether AI-generated code is good enough?"
- "Tell me about a time you identified a problem before it became critical."
- "Describe a decision you made that turned out to be wrong. What did you learn?"

**Rating:** ___

**Evidence/Notes:**

### 2. Product Judgment

**What we're assessing:** The ability to determine what should be built and why it matters.

| Rating | Indicators |
|--------|-----------|
| **3 - Strong** | Prioritizes ruthlessly based on user value and business impact. Knows what to cut without being asked. Understands user problems deeply. Can articulate why something matters (or doesn't). Scope decisions prove sound. |
| **2 - Developing** | Can evaluate requirements and ask good questions. Sometimes over-builds or under-scopes. Understands user needs when explained but doesn't always discover them. Needs guidance on prioritization. |
| **1 - Weak** | Builds exactly what's specified without questioning. Doesn't understand why features matter. Gold-plates or cuts too aggressively without rationale. Can't articulate user problems. |

**Probe questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you decided NOT to build something. Why?"
- "How do you decide what's most important to work on?"
- "Describe a feature you built. Why did it matter to users?"
- "When did you push back on a requirement? What happened?"

**Rating:** ___

**Evidence/Notes:**

---

### 3. Design Judgment

**What we're assessing:** The ability to recognize and create good user experiences.

| Rating | Indicators |
|--------|-----------|
| **3 - Strong** | Recognizes good UX intuitively. Can critique and improve interfaces. Understands design as function, not decoration. Creates intuitive interfaces. Sees design problems others miss. |
| **2 - Developing** | Can implement good designs from mockups. Notices obvious UX problems. Understands design principles but doesn't always apply them. Needs feedback to improve own design work. |
| **1 - Weak** | Creates confusing or unusable interfaces. Doesn't notice UX problems. Thinks design is only about aesthetics. Resistant to design feedback. |

**Probe questions:**
- "Show me something you built. Walk me through the UX decisions."
- "What makes a user interface intuitive?"
- "Critique a product you use regularly. What would you improve?"
- "Tell me about a time you improved the UX of something you built."

**Rating:** ___

**Evidence/Notes:**

---

### 4. AI Orchestration

**What we're assessing:** The ability to leverage AI tools effectively.

| Rating | Indicators |
|--------|-----------|
| **3 - Strong** | Decomposes complex problems into AI-solvable chunks. Writes prompts that produce high-quality output. Knows when AI helps vs. when to work manually. Manages multi-agent workflows. Catches subtle AI errors. |
| **2 - Developing** | Uses AI tools effectively for straightforward tasks. Sometimes accepts suboptimal output. Can decompose problems but not always effectively. Learning to prompt more precisely. |
| **1 - Weak** | Doesn't use AI tools or uses them ineffectively. Accepts AI output without evaluation. Can't decompose problems for AI. Spends more time fighting AI than leveraging it. |

**Probe questions:**
- "Walk me through how you would use AI to build [specific feature]."
- "How do you know when AI output is good enough?"
- "Tell me about a time AI tools didn't help. What did you do?"
- "Describe your typical workflow with AI tools."

**Rating:** ___

**Evidence/Notes:**

---

### 5. System Thinking

**What we're assessing:** The ability to see how pieces connect and anticipate effects.

| Rating | Indicators |
|--------|-----------|
| **3 - Strong** | Sees connections and dependencies others miss. Anticipates second-order effects across domains. Understands how changes propagate. Models complex systems mentally. Makes decisions with full system context. |
| **2 - Developing** | Understands direct dependencies. Sometimes misses second-order effects. Can trace system behavior when guided. Needs help seeing cross-domain impacts. |
| **1 - Weak** | Solves problems in isolation. Surprised by downstream effects. Doesn't understand system interactions. Creates solutions that break other things. |

**Probe questions:**
- "Tell me about a change you made that had unexpected effects. What happened?"
- "How do you think about dependencies when designing a feature?"
- "Describe a complex system you've worked with. How did you understand it?"
- "When you build something new, how do you consider impacts on existing systems?"

**Rating:** ___

**Evidence/Notes:**

### 6. Commercial Awareness

**What we're assessing:** The ability to connect work to business value.

| Rating | Indicators |
|--------|-----------|
| **3 - Strong** | Connects every piece of work to business value. Makes trade-offs with cost/value in mind. Doesn't gold-plate. Understands business model. Can articulate ROI of technical decisions. |
| **2 - Developing** | Understands business value when explained. Sometimes over-engineers or under-delivers. Can make trade-offs with guidance. Knows business model but doesn't always apply it. |
| **1 - Weak** | Builds for technical elegance, not business value. Doesn't understand or care about ROI. Gold-plates everything or ships broken things. Can't articulate why work matters to business. |

**Probe questions:**
- "How do you decide when something is 'done enough'?"
- "Tell me about a time you chose the simpler solution. Why?"
- "How does your work connect to business outcomes?"
- "Describe a technical decision you made for business reasons, not technical ones."

**Rating:** ___
