# Builder Interview Guide

## Philosophy

Interviewing for the Builder model differs fundamentally from traditional engineering interviews. We're assessing judgment across six capabilities, not depth in one.

---

## What We're Looking For

### The Builder Profile

- **Breadth over depth** — Strong across multiple domains vs. expert in one
- **Judgment, not just skill** — Makes sound decisions, not just executes
- **AI-native** — Uses AI tools effectively as core of workflow
- **Autonomy** — Delivers complete work without requiring specialists
- **Learning agility** — Develops new capabilities rapidly

### Strong Predictive Signals

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Side projects / entrepreneurial experience | Forced to operate across all capabilities |
| Questions requirements in interview | Product judgment |
| Notices UX issues unprompted | Design judgment |
| Talks about AI tools enthusiastically | AI orchestration |
| Connects work to business outcomes | Commercial awareness |
| Sees dependencies and second-order effects | System thinking |

---

## Interview Structure

### Recommended Format

| Stage | Focus | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Screen | Basic fit, capability breadth check | 30 min |
| Technical | Technical + AI orchestration | 60 min |
| Product/Design | Product + Design judgment | 45 min |
| System/Commercial | System thinking + Commercial awareness | 45 min |
| Culture/Development | Fit + Development capability (for Builders) | 45 min |

### Alternative: Consolidated Format

For faster hiring cycles, combine into 2-3 longer sessions covering all six capabilities.

## Capability Assessment by Interview

### Screen (30 min)

**Purpose:** Determine if candidate has Builder profile indicators

**Key questions:**
- Tell me about something you've built outside of work.
- How do you use AI tools in your development work?
- Tell me about a time you decided NOT to build something.
- What makes you interested in a generalist role?

**Looking for:**
- Evidence of breadth (side projects, cross-functional experience)
- AI tool adoption and sophistication
- Product/commercial thinking
- Self-awareness about strengths and gaps

**Red flags:**
- Deep specialist identity
- Doesn't use or resists AI tools
- Only talks about technical depth
- Can't articulate product/business thinking

---

### Technical + AI Orchestration (60 min)

**Purpose:** Assess Technical Judgment and AI Orchestration

**Structure:**
- 15 min: Technical background and decisions discussion
- 30 min: Live problem with AI tools
- 15 min: Trade-offs and alternatives discussion

**Technical Judgment questions:**
- Walk me through a technical decision you made recently. What trade-offs did you consider?
- How do you decide when code is "good enough"?
- Tell me about a technical decision that turned out to be wrong. What did you learn?

**AI Orchestration questions:**
- Show me how you would approach [specific problem] using AI tools.
- How do you evaluate whether AI-generated code is good enough?
- When do AI tools NOT help?

**Live exercise:**
- Give candidate a realistic problem
- Have them solve it using their preferred AI tools
- Observe how they decompose, prompt, and evaluate

**Looking for:**
- Sound technical judgment in decisions discussed
- Effective AI tool usage
- Critical evaluation of AI output
- Awareness of trade-offs

---

### Product + Design Judgment (45 min)

**Purpose:** Assess Product Judgment and Design Judgment

**Product Judgment questions:**
- Tell me about a time you pushed back on a requirement.
- How do you decide what's most important to work on?
- Describe a feature you built. Why did it matter to users?
- Tell me about something you decided NOT to build.

**Design Judgment questions:**
- Walk me through something you built. What UX decisions did you make?
- Critique a product you use regularly.
- How do you know when a UI is "good"?
- Tell me about a time you improved the UX of something without being asked.

**Live exercise (optional):**
- Show candidate a product/mockup
- Ask them to critique and suggest improvements
- Assess both product and design thinking

**Looking for:**
- Questions requirements, doesn't just implement
- User-centered thinking
- Design awareness beyond aesthetics
- Ability to make scope decisions

---

### System Thinking + Commercial Awareness (45 min)

**Purpose:** Assess System Thinking and Commercial Awareness

**System Thinking questions:**
- Tell me about a change you made that had unexpected effects.
- How do you think about dependencies when designing a feature?
- Describe a complex system you've worked with. How did you understand it?
- When did you anticipate a problem before it happened?

**Commercial Awareness questions:**
- How does your work connect to business outcomes?
- Tell me about a time you chose the simpler solution for business reasons.
- How do you decide when something is "done enough"?
- Describe a technical decision you made for business reasons.

**Live exercise (optional):**
- Present scenario with technical and business trade-offs
- Discuss how they would approach it
- Assess both system thinking and commercial reasoning

**Looking for:**
- Sees connections and dependencies
- Anticipates second-order effects
- Connects work to business value
- Makes trade-offs with business context

---

### Culture + Development (45 min)

**Purpose:** Assess fit and development capability (for Builder roles)

**Culture questions:**
- What environment do you do your best work in?
- Tell me about feedback you received and how you acted on it.
- When did you disagree with a decision? What did you do?

**Development questions (for Builder roles):**
- Have you mentored others? What was your approach?
- How do you help someone improve?
- Tell me about a time you helped someone grow.

**Looking for:**
- Alignment with autonomous, high-trust culture
- Feedback receptivity
- Development capability (for Builders)
- Self-awareness

## Scorecard Summary

After interviews, assess each capability:

| Capability | Rating (1-3) | Key Evidence |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Technical Judgment | | |
| Product Judgment | | |
| Design Judgment | | |
| AI Orchestration | | |
| System Thinking | | |
| Commercial Awareness | | |

**Hiring thresholds:**
- **Master Builder:** Strong (3) in 5-6 capabilities
- **Builder:** Strong (3) in 3-4 capabilities, Developing (2) in others
- **Apprentice:** Developing (2) in most, high learning agility

## Common Mistakes

### Don't do this:

- **Traditional leetcode focus** — We're not hiring for algorithmic puzzle-solving
- **Depth over breadth** — Probing deep in one area at expense of others
- **Ignoring AI tools** — This is a core capability, not optional
- **Specialist bias** — Don't penalize for breadth over depth
- **Ignoring soft signals** — Side projects and cross-functional experience matter

### Do this instead:

- **Assess all six capabilities**
- **Watch them work with AI tools**
- **Explore breadth indicators**
- **Value judgment over knowledge**
- **Look for product/design/commercial thinking**
