# Builder (Delivery)

## Role Overview

The Delivery Builder is an autonomous generalist who ships complete products using AI tools. This role owns end-to-end delivery—from understanding what to build, through building it, to ensuring it works for users. Unlike traditional engineering roles, Builders are accountable for outcomes, not activities.

Success in this role requires strong judgment across multiple capabilities, effective use of AI tools, and the ability to deliver without requiring a team of specialists. Delivery Builders also develop Apprentices, ensuring the organization can grow its Builder capacity over time.

## Success Outcomes

Success in this role means achieving the following outcomes:

### Product Delivery

- Complete features and products shipped from concept to production
- Work delivered on time with appropriate quality trade-offs
- User problems solved, not just requirements implemented
- Technical debt managed—neither accumulated recklessly nor gold-plated

### Quality & Reliability

- Systems that work reliably in production
- AI-generated code evaluated critically and improved where needed
- Edge cases considered and handled appropriately
- Production issues resolved quickly when they occur

### Apprentice Development

- Apprentices who grow in capability through effective mentorship
- Work assigned that stretches Apprentices appropriately
- Feedback provided that accelerates learning
- At least one Apprentice progressing toward Builder readiness

### Collaboration & Communication

- Master Builder kept informed of architectural decisions and risks
- Stakeholders understand what's being built and why
- Dependencies identified and managed proactively
- Help sought when facing challenges beyond current capability

## Required Capabilities

### Strong (3) in at least 4 capabilities:

| Capability | Delivery Builder Expectation |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Technical Judgment | Makes sound architectural decisions within product scope. Evaluates AI output critically. |
| Product Judgment | Knows what to build and what to cut. Challenges requirements when appropriate. |
| Design Judgment | Creates interfaces that work for users. Notices and fixes UX problems. |
| AI Orchestration | Uses AI tools effectively for all aspects of delivery. |
| System Thinking | Understands how product fits into larger ecosystem. Anticipates impacts. |
| Commercial Awareness | Connects work to business value. Makes appropriate trade-offs. |

### Developing (2) acceptable in 1-2 capabilities

No capability should be Weak (1)—critical gaps prevent autonomous operation.

## Required Experience

### Demonstrated Track Record

- Shipped complete products or significant features end-to-end
- Made product and design decisions, not just implemented specifications
- Used AI tools to accelerate delivery (not just experimentation)
- Worked effectively without a full team of specialists

### Evidence of Breadth

- Side projects demonstrating capabilities beyond pure engineering
- Experience making trade-offs across product, design, technical, and commercial dimensions
- Track record of autonomous delivery with minimal oversight

### Years of Experience

- Typically 4-8 years, but capability matters more than tenure
- Must have meaningful experience with AI-assisted development

---

## Development Responsibility

Delivery Builders develop Apprentices:

- Assign work that develops capabilities
- Provide regular feedback on all six capabilities
- Model good judgment through their own work
- Escalate to Master Builder when Apprentice needs guidance beyond Builder's capability

Typical ratio: 1 Builder : 1-2 Apprentices

---

## Relationship to Master Builder

Builders operate autonomously within product scope but:

- Escalate architectural decisions with cross-product implications
- Seek guidance when facing challenges beyond their capability
- Align on technical patterns and standards
- Report risks and blockers proactively

Master Builder provides:
- Architectural oversight and coherence
- Development guidance for the Builder
- Escalation path for hard problems
- Cover for Builder gaps while they develop

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following patterns suggest someone is NOT ready for Delivery Builder:

- **Needs detailed specifications** — Cannot determine what to build without Product Manager
- **Ignores UX** — Ships functional but unusable products
- **Doesn't use AI tools** — Works the "old way" and resists new approaches
- **Cannot estimate or commit** — Doesn't understand scope or own delivery
- **Specialist identity** — Sees themselves as "just an engineer"

## Progression

### From Apprentice

Apprentice → Builder requires:
- Demonstrated autonomy across most capabilities
- Consistent delivery without close supervision
- No critical capability gaps

### To Master Builder

Builder → Master Builder requires:
- Successful development of Apprentices into Builders
- Architectural ownership beyond single product
- Strong (3) in all six capabilities
