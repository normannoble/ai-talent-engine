# Apprentice

## Role Overview

The Apprentice is a developing generalist learning all six capabilities under direct guidance from a Builder. This role is fundamentally a learning position—Apprentices contribute meaningfully to product delivery while developing the judgment needed to become Builders.

Success in this role requires learning agility, coachability, and the drive to develop breadth across all capabilities. Unlike traditional junior engineering roles that develop depth in one domain, Apprentices must embrace the challenge of becoming capable generalists.

## Success Outcomes

Success in this role means achieving the following outcomes:

### Capability Development

- Measurable growth across all six capabilities over time
- Movement from Weak (1) to Developing (2) in initial gap areas
- Movement from Developing (2) to Strong (3) in areas of emerging strength
- Clear trajectory toward Builder readiness

### Contribution to Delivery

- Tasks and features completed with quality appropriate to guidance received
- Increasing scope of work handled autonomously over time
- Blockers surfaced early rather than spinning in silence
- Production-worthy output with decreasing oversight required

### Learning Behaviors

- Feedback sought proactively, not just received
- Mistakes acknowledged and learned from
- AI output evaluated critically, not accepted blindly
- Questions asked that demonstrate growing understanding

### Collaboration

- Builder mentor kept informed of progress and blockers
- Help sought appropriately—neither too often nor too rarely
- Knowledge documented and shared with others
- Positive contribution to team culture

## Capability Development Path

### Starting Point (Typical)

Most Apprentices enter with:
- Technical Judgment: Developing (2) — some coding ability
- Product Judgment: Weak (1) or Developing (2) — little exposure
- Design Judgment: Weak (1) or Developing (2) — little exposure
- AI Orchestration: Variable — depends on background
- System Thinking: Weak (1) or Developing (2) — early in career
- Commercial Awareness: Weak (1) — little exposure

### Target for Builder Readiness

To progress to Builder, Apprentice must reach:
- At least 3-4 capabilities at Strong (3)
- Remaining capabilities at Developing (2)
- No capabilities at Weak (1)
- Demonstrated autonomous delivery

### Development Timeline

Typical progression: 12-24 months

Factors that accelerate:
- Starting with broader experience (career changers, entrepreneurs)
- High learning agility
- Intensive mentorship from strong Builder
- Challenging assignments that stretch capabilities

Factors that slow:
- Starting with narrow technical focus only
- Resistance to developing non-technical capabilities
- Limited feedback-seeking behavior
- Assignments that don't stretch capability breadth

## The Learning Curriculum

Unlike traditional engineering roles where juniors learn by doing simpler versions of senior work, Apprentices learn by developing judgment across all six capabilities.

### Technical Judgment

- Building features with AI assistance and Builder review
- Learning to evaluate when AI output is good vs. problematic
- Understanding architectural patterns and trade-offs
- Debugging and production support exposure

### Product Judgment

- Participating in product decisions, not just implementing
- Required to articulate "why" for features they build
- Exposure to user feedback and product metrics
- Practice prioritizing and scoping work

### Design Judgment

- Building UI with attention to UX, not just functionality
- Design critique sessions with Builder
- User testing exposure
- Practice explaining design decisions

### AI Orchestration

- AI-first approach to all development work
- Prompt engineering practice
- Multi-agent workflow exposure
- Learning when AI helps vs. when to work manually

### System Thinking

- Tracing dependencies and impacts
- Debugging production issues
- Cross-feature integration work
- Learning to anticipate second-order effects

### Commercial Awareness

- Exposure to business metrics and context
- ROI discussions for features they build
- Understanding business model and value creation
- Practice making cost/value trade-offs

## Relationship to Builder

Apprentices work directly with a Builder mentor who:

- Assigns work that develops capabilities
- Provides regular feedback on all six dimensions
- Reviews work with a teaching lens, not just quality control
- Adjusts challenge level based on growth

Typical ratio: 1 Builder : 1-2 Apprentices

### What Apprentices Should Expect

- Regular 1:1 time with Builder mentor
- Feedback on capability growth, not just task completion
- Increasing autonomy as capability grows
- Clear communication about readiness for Builder progression

### What Builders Expect from Apprentices

- Proactive communication about progress and blockers
- Feedback-seeking behavior
- Willingness to work outside comfort zone
- Ownership of learning, not just assigned tasks

---

## Required Characteristics

### Learning Agility

- Picks up new concepts quickly
- Transfers learning across domains
- Comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty
- Seeks challenge rather than comfort

### Coachability

- Receives feedback non-defensively
- Acts on feedback visibly
- Asks clarifying questions
- Acknowledges gaps openly

### Breadth Orientation

- Curious about all aspects of product development
- Doesn't dismiss non-technical work as "not my job"
- Sees value in becoming a generalist
- Willing to develop weaker capabilities

### Ownership Mentality

- Takes responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks
- Surfaces problems rather than hiding them
- Finishes work rather than moving on
- Cares about quality beyond "good enough to pass review"

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following patterns suggest someone is NOT suited for Apprentice role:

- **Specialist identity** — Only wants to develop technical depth
- **Feedback resistance** — Defensive when receiving critique
- **Learned helplessness** — Waits to be told what to do
- **AI skepticism** — Resists using AI tools
- **Narrow curiosity** — Only interested in one aspect of product development

---

## Entry Points

### From University/Bootcamp

Traditional entry path. Will need development across all capabilities.

Key selection criteria:
- Demonstrated breadth of interests
- Projects showing product/design thinking, not just code
- Learning agility evidence
- Coachability in interview process

### From Traditional Junior Roles

Transition from IC1/IC2 engineering roles.

Key assessment:
- Willingness to develop breadth
- Openness to non-engineering capabilities
- AI tool adoption
- Interest in the Builder model

### From Other Domains

Career changers from design, product, or other fields.

Key assessment:
- Technical learning ability
- Existing strengths in non-technical capabilities
- Motivation for breadth
- Realistic understanding of learning required

## Progression to Builder

Apprentice → Builder requires:

1. **Capability threshold** — Strong (3) in 3-4 capabilities, Developing (2) in others, no Weak (1) areas
2. **Autonomous delivery** — Can complete significant work without close supervision
3. **Judgment evidence** — Makes sound decisions across capability areas
4. **Builder endorsement** — Mentor confirms readiness based on sustained performance

Typical timeline: 12-24 months of focused development
