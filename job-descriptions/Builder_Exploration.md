# Builder (Exploration)

## Role Overview

The Exploration Builder is an autonomous generalist who focuses on blue sky thinking, rapid prototyping, and validating new product ideas. Unlike Delivery Builders, Exploration Builders prioritize speed of learning over production-quality delivery. Their output is validated ideas and working prototypes, not polished products.

Success in this role requires strong judgment across multiple capabilities, comfort with ambiguity, and the ability to move fast while still producing meaningful signal about what works. Exploration Builders do not typically develop Apprentices—their focus on speed and iteration makes the teaching overhead counterproductive.

---

## Success Outcomes

Success in this role means achieving the following outcomes:

### Idea Validation

- New product concepts explored and validated (or invalidated) quickly
- Working prototypes that demonstrate feasibility and user value
- Clear signal generated about what works and what doesn't
- Dead ends identified early, saving organization from larger investments

### Speed of Learning

- Prototypes built in days/weeks, not months
- Multiple ideas explored in parallel when appropriate
- Fast iteration based on feedback and learning
- Willingness to throw away work when direction changes

### Quality of Signal

- Prototypes that are good enough to test hypotheses
- User feedback gathered and synthesized
- Technical feasibility assessed realistically
- Handoff artifacts that enable Delivery Builders to productize

### Innovation Pipeline

- Continuous flow of new ideas explored
- Some ideas validated and moved to delivery
- Portfolio approach—many small bets, not one big bet
- Organization's product direction informed by exploration findings

## Required Capabilities

### Strong (3) in at least 4 capabilities:

| Capability | Exploration Builder Expectation |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Technical Judgment | Builds fast but not recklessly. Knows what shortcuts are acceptable for prototypes. |
| Product Judgment | Strong hypothesis formation. Knows what to test and how to get signal. |
| Design Judgment | Creates prototypes that users can actually evaluate. Good enough UX for testing. |
| AI Orchestration | Uses AI tools aggressively for speed. |
| System Thinking | Understands how prototypes might evolve into products. |
| Commercial Awareness | Evaluates ideas against business viability, not just user interest. |

### Developing (2) acceptable in 1-2 capabilities

No capability should be Weak (1)—exploration still requires judgment across domains.

---

## Required Experience

### Demonstrated Track Record

- Built prototypes or MVPs that generated meaningful learning
- Made fast decisions under uncertainty
- Experience in 0→1 product development (not just iteration)
- Comfort throwing away work when direction changes

### Evidence of Breadth

- Entrepreneurial experience or side projects
- Experience across multiple product domains
- Track record of generating and testing ideas quickly

### Years of Experience

- Typically 4-8 years, but capability matters more than tenure
- Must be highly proficient with AI tools for rapid development

## Development Responsibility

Exploration Builders typically do NOT develop Apprentices.

Rationale:
- Speed is the priority—teaching overhead slows exploration
- Work is often thrown away—poor learning environment for Apprentices
- Direction changes frequently—hard for Apprentices to build sustained capability

Exception: An Apprentice might shadow an Exploration Builder for short periods to learn the exploration mindset, but primary development should come from a Delivery Builder.

---

## Relationship to Master Builder

Exploration Builders operate with significant autonomy but:

- Align on exploration priorities with Master Builder and product leadership
- Share learnings and recommendations
- Hand off validated concepts with technical feasibility assessment
- Flag when exploration uncovers architectural implications

Master Builder provides:
- Strategic direction on what to explore
- Technical guidance on feasibility questions
- Connection to Delivery Builders for productization
- Evaluation of exploration effectiveness

---

## Relationship to Delivery Builders

Exploration and Delivery are complementary:

| Exploration Builder | Delivery Builder |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Speed of learning | Quality of delivery |
| Throw-away prototypes | Production systems |
| Hypothesis testing | User value creation |
| 0→1 | 1→N |

Handoff from Exploration to Delivery includes:
- Working prototype demonstrating concept
- User feedback and validation data
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Recommended approach for production implementation

---

## Anti-Patterns

The following patterns suggest someone is NOT suited for Exploration Builder:

- **Perfectionist** — Cannot ship "good enough" prototypes
- **Attached to code** — Struggles to throw away work
- **Needs clarity** — Cannot operate with ambiguous direction
- **Builder identity** — Wants to see work in production
- **Risk averse** — Uncomfortable with high failure rate

---

## When to Use Exploration Builders

Good fit:
- New product initiatives with high uncertainty
- Market exploration before major investment
- Technical feasibility assessment for novel approaches
- Rapid prototyping for user research

Less suited:
- Established products needing iteration
- Well-defined requirements
- Production system development
- Situations where throwing away work is wasteful

---

## Progression

Exploration Builders can progress to:
- **Master Builder** — If they develop Builder development capability
- **Delivery Builder** — If they want to focus on shipping production products

Note: Exploration is not "lower" than Delivery—it's a different focus area with different success criteria.
