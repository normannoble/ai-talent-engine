# The Six Capabilities

The Builder model assesses individuals across six capabilities. These replace traditional single-domain expertise with multi-domain judgment.

---

## Overview

| Capability | Traditional Role Equivalent | Core Question |
|------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Technical Judgment | Software Engineer | Can they build it right? |
| Product Judgment | Product Manager | Can they build the right thing? |
| Design Judgment | Designer | Can they make it work for users? |
| AI Orchestration | (New capability) | Can they leverage AI effectively? |
| System Thinking | Engineering Manager / Architect | Can they see how pieces connect? |
| Commercial Awareness | Business Analyst / PM | Can they connect work to value? |

## 1. Technical Judgment

**Definition:** The ability to make sound decisions about how software should be built, including architecture, code quality, performance, security, and maintainability.

### What "Strong" Looks Like

- Sees architectural implications before they become problems
- Knows when AI-generated code is fragile, inefficient, or wrong
- Understands trade-offs and chooses appropriately for context
- Can evaluate technical debt and prioritize it against features
- Makes decisions that prove sound over time

### What "Developing" Looks Like

- Makes sound decisions in familiar contexts
- Sometimes misses edge cases or long-term implications
- Can evaluate AI output but occasionally accepts problematic code
- Needs guidance on unfamiliar architectural patterns

### What "Weak" Looks Like

- Accepts AI output without critical evaluation
- Makes decisions that create problems downstream
- Doesn't see trade-offs or always chooses the same option
- Struggles to debug or understand system behavior

### Assessment Questions

- "Walk me through a technical decision you made recently. What trade-offs did you consider?"
- "How do you evaluate whether AI-generated code is good enough?"
- "Tell me about a time you identified a problem before it became critical."

---

## 2. Product Judgment

**Definition:** The ability to determine what should be built, why it matters, and what can be cut—connecting user needs to solutions.

### What "Strong" Looks Like

- Prioritizes ruthlessly based on user value and business impact
- Knows what to cut without being asked
- Understands user problems deeply enough to evaluate solutions
- Can articulate why something matters (or doesn't)
- Makes scope decisions that prove sound over time

### What "Developing" Looks Like

- Can evaluate requirements and ask good questions
- Sometimes over-builds or under-scopes
- Understands user needs when explained but doesn't always discover them
- Needs guidance on prioritization trade-offs

### What "Weak" Looks Like

- Builds exactly what's specified without questioning
- Doesn't understand why features matter
- Gold-plates or cuts too aggressively
- Can't articulate user problems

### Assessment Questions

- "Tell me about a time you decided NOT to build something. Why?"
- "How do you decide what's most important to work on?"
- "Describe a product you use and what you would change about it. Why?"

## 3. Design Judgment

**Definition:** The ability to recognize and create good user experiences—understanding that design is how it works, not just how it looks.

### What "Strong" Looks Like

- Recognizes good UX intuitively
- Can critique and improve interfaces
- Understands that design is function, not decoration
- Creates interfaces that are intuitive without documentation
- Sees design problems that others miss

### What "Developing" Looks Like

- Can implement good designs from mockups
- Notices obvious UX problems
- Understands design principles but doesn't always apply them
- Needs feedback to improve their own design work

### What "Weak" Looks Like

- Creates confusing or unusable interfaces
- Doesn't notice UX problems
- Thinks design is only about aesthetics
- Resistant to design feedback

### Assessment Questions

- "Show me something you built. Walk me through the UX decisions."
- "What makes a user interface intuitive?"
- "Critique a product you use regularly. What would you improve?"

## 4. AI Orchestration

**Definition:** The ability to effectively leverage AI tools to accelerate work—knowing how to decompose problems, write effective prompts, and evaluate AI output critically.

### What "Strong" Looks Like

- Decomposes complex problems into AI-solvable chunks
- Writes prompts that produce high-quality output
- Knows when AI will help vs. when to work manually
- Manages multi-agent workflows effectively
- Evaluates AI output critically, catching subtle errors

### What "Developing" Looks Like

- Uses AI tools effectively for straightforward tasks
- Sometimes accepts suboptimal AI output
- Can decompose problems but not always effectively
- Learning to prompt more precisely

### What "Weak" Looks Like

- Doesn't use AI tools or uses them ineffectively
- Accepts AI output without evaluation
- Can't decompose problems for AI
- Spends more time fighting AI than leveraging it

### Assessment Questions

- "Walk me through how you would use AI to build [specific feature]."
- "How do you know when AI output is good enough?"
- "Tell me about a time AI tools didn't help. What did you do?"

---

## 5. System Thinking

**Definition:** The ability to see how pieces connect—understanding dependencies, anticipating second-order effects, and grasping complex interdependencies.

### What "Strong" Looks Like

- Sees connections and dependencies others miss
- Anticipates second-order effects across technical and business domains
- Understands how a change here affects things over there
- Can model complex systems mentally
- Makes decisions with full system context

### What "Developing" Looks Like

- Understands direct dependencies
- Sometimes misses second-order effects
- Can trace system behavior when guided
- Needs help seeing cross-domain impacts

### What "Weak" Looks Like

- Solves problems in isolation
- Surprised by downstream effects of changes
- Doesn't understand how systems interact
- Creates solutions that break other things

### Assessment Questions

- "Tell me about a change you made that had unexpected effects. What happened?"
- "How do you think about dependencies when designing a feature?"
- "Describe a complex system you've worked with. How did you build a mental model?"

## 6. Commercial Awareness

**Definition:** The ability to connect work to business value—understanding what creates value, making cost/value trade-offs, and avoiding over-engineering.

### What "Strong" Looks Like

- Connects every piece of work to business value
- Makes trade-offs with cost/value in mind
- Doesn't gold-plate—ships "good enough"
- Understands business model and how work contributes to it
- Can articulate ROI of technical decisions

### What "Developing" Looks Like

- Understands business value when explained
- Sometimes over-engineers or under-delivers
- Can make trade-offs with guidance
- Knows the business model but doesn't always apply it

### What "Weak" Looks Like

- Builds for technical elegance, not business value
- Doesn't understand or care about ROI
- Gold-plates everything or ships broken things
- Can't articulate why work matters to the business

### Assessment Questions

- "How do you decide when something is 'done enough'?"
- "Tell me about a time you chose the simpler solution. Why?"
- "How does your work connect to business outcomes?"

## Capability Combinations

### Master Builder Profile

Strong (3) in 5-6 capabilities. No weak spots. Typically exceptional in Technical Judgment and System Thinking with strong breadth elsewhere.

### Builder Profile

Strong (3) in 3-4 capabilities. Developing (2) in others. No critical weak spots (1). Typically strong in Technical Judgment and AI Orchestration.

### Apprentice Profile

Developing (2) in most areas. May have one area of emerging strength. Shows learning agility across all capabilities.

## Development Notes

- Capabilities are developed through **doing**, not studying
- Side projects force breadth because there's no one else to do it
- Mentorship from Builders/Master Builders accelerates development
- Some capabilities are harder to develop than others—Commercial Awareness often requires exposure to business context
- AI Orchestration is a new capability—even experienced engineers may need to develop it
