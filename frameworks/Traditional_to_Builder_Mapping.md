# Traditional to Builder Mapping

This guide helps organizations assess existing team members against the Builder model and identify potential candidates for transition.

---

## Role Mapping Overview

| Traditional Role | Potential Builder Level | Key Gaps to Assess |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Junior Engineer (IC1) | Apprentice | Breadth development needed across all capabilities |
| Mid Engineer (IC2) | Apprentice / Builder | Product, Design, Commercial, AI Orchestration |
| Senior Engineer (IC3) | Builder candidate | Product, Design, Commercial awareness |
| Staff Engineer (IC4) | Builder / Master Builder candidate | Design, Commercial; may have Product & System |
| Distinguished Engineer (IC5) | Master Builder candidate | Design, Commercial; usually has System Thinking |
| Tech Lead | Builder candidate | May have Product, often lacks Design/Commercial |
| Engineering Manager (M1-M2) | Builder candidate | Technical depth may have atrophied |
| Director+ (M3/E1+) | Master Builder candidate | May lack hands-on AI Orchestration |

## What Traditional Levels Bring

### IC1-IC2 (Junior/Mid Engineer)

**Strengths:**
- Learning agility
- Current with modern tools and practices
- Adaptable

**Gaps:**
- Technical Judgment still developing
- No Product/Design/Commercial exposure
- May not have AI Orchestration experience

**Builder Potential:** Apprentice. Need full development program.

---

### IC3 (Senior Engineer)

**Strengths:**
- Technical Judgment established
- Some System Thinking
- Can work autonomously
- Often mentors others

**Gaps:**
- Product Judgment—may implement without questioning
- Design Judgment—may dismiss as "not my job"
- Commercial Awareness—may not connect work to value
- AI Orchestration—variable depending on adoption

**Builder Potential:** Strong Builder candidate IF they have breadth indicators (side projects, cross-functional experience).

**Key Assessment:** Do they question requirements? Do they notice UX problems? Do they understand business context?

---

### IC4-IC5 (Staff/Distinguished)

**Strengths:**
- Deep Technical Judgment
- Strong System Thinking
- Organizational influence
- Develops others

**Gaps:**
- Design Judgment—often weak after years of specialization
- Commercial Awareness—may have it at strategic level but not product level
- AI Orchestration—may resist new tools or haven't adopted them

**Builder Potential:** Master Builder candidate IF they can develop breadth. Their depth in Technical Judgment and System Thinking is valuable.

**Key Assessment:** Can they let go of specialization identity? Are they willing to develop new capabilities?

---

### Tech Leads

**Strengths:**
- Technical Judgment
- Some Product Judgment (from stakeholder collaboration)
- Team coordination experience

**Gaps:**
- Design Judgment—often weak
- Commercial Awareness—variable
- AI Orchestration—variable

**Builder Potential:** Good Builder candidate. Transition is about deepening breadth they've started to develop.

---

### Engineering Managers (M1-M2)

**Strengths:**
- System Thinking (organizational)
- People development capability
- Cross-functional collaboration

**Gaps:**
- Technical Judgment—may have atrophied
- AI Orchestration—may not be hands-on
- Design Judgment—often weak

**Builder Potential:** Challenging transition. Management skills are valuable for Master Builder, but need to rebuild hands-on technical capability.

---

## The Side Hustle Signal

**Why side projects matter:**

When someone builds something outside work—a side business, an app, a project—they are forced to operate across all six capabilities:
- Technical Judgment (building it)
- Product Judgment (deciding what to build)
- Design Judgment (making it usable)
- AI Orchestration (if recent, likely using AI tools)
- System Thinking (making pieces work together)
- Commercial Awareness (if selling, finding product-market fit)

**Assessment question:** "Tell me about something you've built outside of work."

Strong responses include:
- Clear product decisions (why this, why not that)
- Design thinking (how users would interact)
- Technical trade-offs (why built this way)
- Commercial awareness (who would use this, why it matters)

---

## Assessment Framework

### Quick Screen

| Signal | What It Indicates |
|--------|------------------|
| Has shipped side projects | Demonstrated breadth |
| Questions product requirements | Product Judgment potential |
| Notices and mentions UX issues | Design Judgment potential |
| Uses AI tools effectively | AI Orchestration capability |
| Talks about business impact | Commercial Awareness |
| Sees cross-system dependencies | System Thinking |

## Transition Paths

### IC3 → Builder (12-18 months)

**Focus areas:**
1. Product Judgment—involve in product decisions, require them to defend scope
2. Design Judgment—pair with design reviews, require UX critique
3. Commercial Awareness—expose to business metrics, require ROI thinking
4. AI Orchestration—require AI-first approach to new work

**Development approach:**
- Assign complete features end-to-end
- Require product/design/commercial rationale in proposals
- Pair with Builder mentor who demonstrates breadth

---

### IC4+ → Master Builder (6-12 months)

**Focus areas:**
1. Design Judgment—often the biggest gap
2. AI Orchestration—may need to rebuild habits
3. Developer development—transition from technical mentorship to Builder mentorship

**Development approach:**
- Own a product end-to-end
- Develop an Apprentice
- Required to ship without design support

---

### Manager → Builder (Variable)

**This is the hardest transition.** Management skills are valuable for Master Builder, but the path requires rebuilding hands-on capability.

**Assessment first:**
- How recent is their hands-on technical work?
- Are they willing to be a Builder before becoming a Master Builder?
- Can they accept being evaluated on output, not people management?

**If viable:**
1. Start as Builder on a new product
2. Rebuild technical + AI Orchestration capability
3. Then develop toward Master Builder

---

## When Not to Transition

Some people are better served by remaining in traditional roles:

- **Deep specialists** who excel at and love depth over breadth
- **Managers** whose strength is people development, not building
- **Those who resist AI tools** or don't believe in the model
- **Those approaching retirement** who don't want to rebuild their skillset

This model is not superior to traditional roles—it's suited for different contexts. Respect individual preferences and strengths.

---

## Organizational Considerations

### Parallel Tracks

Many organizations will maintain both models:
- **Builder track** for greenfield, high-velocity products
- **Traditional track** for established products, specialized domains

Allowing movement between tracks increases flexibility.

### Compensation

Builder roles are high-leverage. Compensation should reflect:
- Breadth of capability
- Scarcity of qualified candidates
- Output delivered with smaller teams

### Hiring

Once you understand the Builder profile, you may find more candidates outside traditional engineering:
- Entrepreneurs who've built products
- Designers who code
- Product people who've shipped
- Engineers with successful side businesses
