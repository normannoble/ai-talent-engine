# AI-Native Engineering Model

## Core Philosophy

**Seniority in AI-native engineering is about judgment breadth, not specialization depth.**

Traditional engineering values deep expertise in one domain. AI-native engineering values the ability to exercise sound judgment across multiple domains—because AI tools can execute, but they cannot judge.

## The Three Tiers

### Master Builder

**Definition:** The senior-most technical role. Owns architectural coherence across products. Develops Builders. The constraint on organizational scale.

**Scope:** Organization or major product area  
**Autonomy:** Sets technical direction  
**Impact:** Multiplies effectiveness across the organization  

**Characteristics:**
- Exceptional judgment across all six capabilities
- Can evaluate AI output at a systemic level—sees patterns of failure others miss
- Develops Builders—transfers judgment, not just reviews work
- Makes architectural decisions with multi-year implications
- Trusted to make the highest-stakes technical decisions

**Development Responsibility:** Develops Builders

**Rarity:** Rare. Perhaps 5-10% of what would traditionally be "senior engineers."

### Builder

**Definition:** An autonomous generalist who ships complete products using AI tools. Strong in most capabilities with no critical gaps.

**Scope:** Product or major feature area  
**Autonomy:** Self-directed within product scope  
**Impact:** Delivers complete, high-quality products  

**Characteristics:**
- Strong judgment in 4-5 capabilities, developing in others
- Executes autonomously with AI tools—produces good output without supervision
- Knows the limits of their judgment and escalates appropriately
- Can evaluate AI output critically within their areas of strength
- Accountable for delivery, not just contribution

**Development Responsibility:** Develops Apprentices

**Two Variants:**

| Type | Focus | Develops Apprentice? |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| **Delivery Builder** | Shipping products, operational excellence | Yes |
| **Exploration Builder** | Blue sky thinking, prototyping, validating new ideas | No |

---

### Apprentice

**Definition:** A developing generalist learning all six capabilities under direct guidance from a Builder.

**Scope:** Tasks and features within a product  
**Autonomy:** Supervised, with increasing independence over time  
**Impact:** Personal contribution plus learning  

**Characteristics:**
- Developing judgment—has potential but not yet reliable autonomy
- Learning to evaluate AI output critically rather than accepting it
- Works under direct guidance of a Builder
- The "curriculum" is developing pattern recognition across all six capabilities
- Shows learning agility and coachability

**Development Responsibility:** Learning

## Development Flow

```
Master Builder
     │
     │ develops
     ▼
  Builder
     │
     │ develops
     ▼
 Apprentice
```

This is a 1:1 or 1:2 development relationship, not a traditional management ratio. It's closer to a master/apprentice model than a manager/team model.

## Progression Criteria

### Apprentice → Builder

**Core Question:** Can this person produce good output autonomously?

**Evidence Required:**
- Consistently delivers quality work without close supervision
- Makes sound judgments in their areas of strength
- Knows when they're out of their depth and escalates appropriately
- Has developed strength (3) in at least 3-4 capabilities
- Has no critical weak spots (1) in any capability

**Timeline:** Typically 12-24 months, depending on starting point and intensity

---

### Builder → Master Builder

**Core Question:** Can this person develop other Builders and own architectural coherence?

**Evidence Required:**
- Has successfully developed at least one Apprentice into a Builder
- Makes architectural decisions that prove sound over time
- Strong (3) in 5-6 capabilities with no gaps
- Trusted by other Builders as a technical authority
- Can evaluate and course-correct AI output at a systemic level

**Timeline:** Typically 3-5+ years as a Builder, though exceptional individuals may progress faster

---

## Organizational Implications

### Team Size

Traditional teams: 5-10 people (specialists + coordination)
Builder teams: 2-4 people (generalists with minimal coordination overhead)

### Hiring Profile

Traditional: Deep expertise in one domain, learning potential in others
Builder: Demonstrated breadth across domains, often evidenced by side projects or entrepreneurial experience

### The Master Builder Constraint

You cannot scale faster than you can develop or acquire Master Builders. They are the bottleneck on growth. This is a feature, not a bug—it prevents scaling faster than quality can be maintained.

## Comparison to Traditional Model

| Dimension | Traditional | AI-Native |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Primary value | Deep specialization | Broad judgment |
| Team structure | Specialists + coordination | Generalists with minimal overhead |
| Scaling model | Add headcount | Develop Master Builders |
| AI tools | Accelerate existing work | Fundamental to delivery model |
| Development focus | Technical depth | Judgment breadth |
| Bottleneck | Hiring pipeline | Master Builder capacity |

## When to Use This Model

**Good fit:**
- Greenfield products where speed matters
- Small, high-output teams
- Products where iteration speed is critical
- Organizations with strong senior talent who can be Master Builders

**Less suited:**
- Large existing codebases requiring deep specialized knowledge
- Highly regulated domains requiring specialized compliance expertise
- Organizations without Master Builder candidates
- Teams where AI tools are not yet mature for the domain

## Living Document

This model is evolving as AI tools and practices mature. The core insight—that judgment is the constraint, not hands—is stable. The specific capabilities and structures may evolve.
