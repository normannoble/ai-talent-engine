# Apprentice to Builder Progression Guide

## Overview

This guide helps Apprentices and their Builder mentors navigate the progression to Builder level.

**Typical timeline:** 12-24 months

---

## What Changes at Builder Level

| Dimension | Apprentice | Builder |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Autonomy | Guided work with oversight | Self-directed within product scope |
| Scope | Tasks and features | Complete products/features end-to-end |
| Judgment | Developing across capabilities | Sound in 4+ capabilities |
| Development responsibility | Learning | Develops Apprentices |
| AI usage | Learning effective usage | Proficient, critical evaluation |
| Accountability | Contribution | Outcomes |

---

## Capability Development Targets

### Starting Point (Typical Apprentice)

| Capability | Typical Starting Level |
|------------|----------------------|
| Technical Judgment | Developing (2) |
| Product Judgment | Weak (1) - Developing (2) |
| Design Judgment | Weak (1) - Developing (2) |
| AI Orchestration | Variable |
| System Thinking | Weak (1) - Developing (2) |
| Commercial Awareness | Weak (1) |

### Target for Builder

| Capability | Required Level |
|------------|---------------|
| Technical Judgment | Strong (3) |
| Product Judgment | Developing (2) - Strong (3) |
| Design Judgment | Developing (2) - Strong (3) |
| AI Orchestration | Strong (3) |
| System Thinking | Developing (2) - Strong (3) |
| Commercial Awareness | Developing (2) |

**Minimum:** Strong (3) in 3-4 capabilities, Developing (2) in others, no Weak (1) areas

## Development Activities by Capability

### Technical Judgment

**Activities:**
- Own increasingly complex technical decisions
- Review AI output critically before accepting
- Debug production issues
- Participate in architectural discussions

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Made technical decision that proved sound over 3+ months
- [ ] Caught problematic AI output that would have caused issues
- [ ] Debugged production issue independently
- [ ] Contributed to architectural discussion meaningfully

### Product Judgment

**Activities:**
- Participate in product planning discussions
- Question requirements rather than just implementing
- Propose scope reductions when appropriate
- Connect with users/stakeholders directly

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Successfully pushed back on a requirement with good rationale
- [ ] Made scope decision that improved outcome
- [ ] Articulated "why" for features built
- [ ] Gathered and acted on user feedback

### Design Judgment

**Activities:**
- Build UI with attention to UX
- Participate in design critiques
- Improve UX of features without being asked
- Observe users interacting with your work

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Identified and fixed UX problem independently
- [ ] Received positive feedback on interface usability
- [ ] Contributed meaningfully to design discussion
- [ ] Built feature with intuitive UX from scratch

### AI Orchestration

**Activities:**
- Use AI tools for all development work
- Experiment with different prompting approaches
- Learn multi-agent workflows
- Evaluate AI output quality systematically

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Shipped feature built primarily with AI assistance
- [ ] Developed effective prompting patterns for common tasks
- [ ] Used multi-agent workflow successfully
- [ ] Taught another Apprentice effective AI usage

### System Thinking

**Activities:**
- Trace dependencies before making changes
- Consider downstream impacts explicitly
- Build mental models of complex systems
- Document system interactions

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Anticipated impact that others missed
- [ ] Created useful system diagram/documentation
- [ ] Made change with full understanding of dependencies
- [ ] Debugged cross-system issue

### Commercial Awareness

**Activities:**
- Learn business model and metrics
- Connect work to business outcomes
- Make cost/value trade-offs explicitly
- Discuss ROI of features

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Articulated business value of work done
- [ ] Made trade-off decision with business rationale
- [ ] Identified over-engineering and scoped down
- [ ] Proposed feature change based on business value

## Progression Indicators

### Ready for Builder Assessment

**Strong signals:**
- Completes significant work without close oversight
- Makes sound decisions across multiple capabilities
- Builder mentor has decreasing involvement
- Other team members seek their input
- Demonstrates Builder-level judgment consistently for 2+ months

### Not yet ready

**Warning signals:**
- Still needs detailed guidance on most work
- Capability gaps not closing
- Judgment failures in areas that should be developed
- Doesn't seek feedback or act on it
- AI usage still ineffective

---

## For Builder Mentors

### Your Role

- Assign work that stretches capability
- Provide feedback on all six dimensions
- Create space for autonomous work
- Advocate for progression when ready

### Development Approach

**Months 1-6:** High guidance, focus on foundational capabilities
**Months 6-12:** Decreasing guidance, increasing scope
**Months 12-18:** Minimal guidance, Builder-level scope
**Months 18-24:** Assessment readiness, advocate for progression

### Feedback Cadence

- Weekly 1:1s focused on development
- Feedback on each capability quarterly
- Formal assessment at 12 months and progression point

## Assessment Process

When ready for progression:

1. Builder mentor completes initial assessment
2. Apprentice self-assessment using rubric
3. Master Builder review (if available)
4. Progression decision and transition plan

See [Builder Readiness Assessment](../assessment/Builder_Readiness_Assessment.md) for detailed criteria.
