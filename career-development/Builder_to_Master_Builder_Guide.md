# Builder to Master Builder Progression Guide

## Overview

This guide helps Builders navigate the progression to Master Builder level.

**Typical timeline:** 3-5+ years as Builder

**Important note:** Master Builder is not the expected destination for all Builders. Many excellent Builders will stay at Builder level throughout their careers. This progression is for those with both the capability and the inclination for Master Builder responsibilities.

## What Changes at Master Builder Level

| Dimension | Builder | Master Builder |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Scope | Product/feature | Organization/multi-product |
| Development responsibility | Develops Apprentices | Develops Builders |
| Architectural ownership | Within product | Across products |
| Judgment | Strong in 4+ capabilities | Strong in all 6 |
| Influence | Through delivery | Through expertise and credibility |
| AI evaluation | Critical evaluation | Systemic evaluation |
| Constraint role | Delivers within constraints | IS the constraint on scale |

## Capability Development Targets

### Starting Point (Typical Builder)

| Capability | Typical Builder Level |
|------------|---------------------|
| Technical Judgment | Strong (3) |
| Product Judgment | Developing (2) - Strong (3) |
| Design Judgment | Developing (2) - Strong (3) |
| AI Orchestration | Strong (3) |
| System Thinking | Developing (2) - Strong (3) |
| Commercial Awareness | Developing (2) - Strong (3) |

### Target for Master Builder

| Capability | Required Level |
|------------|---------------|
| Technical Judgment | Strong (3) |
| Product Judgment | Strong (3) |
| Design Judgment | Strong (3) |
| AI Orchestration | Strong (3) |
| System Thinking | Strong (3) |

## Key Development Dimensions

### 1. Builder Development Capability

The most distinctive Master Builder capability is developing other Builders.

**Activities:**
- Take on Apprentice development responsibility
- Guide Apprentices through full progression to Builder
- Reflect on what accelerates vs. slows development
- Create development approaches that transfer judgment

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Developed at least one Apprentice to Builder level
- [ ] Created development approach that worked for multiple Apprentices
- [ ] Can articulate what makes development effective
- [ ] Other Builders seek mentorship advice from you

### 2. Architectural Ownership

Master Builders own architecture across products, not just within one.

**Activities:**
- Participate in cross-product architectural decisions
- Consider long-term implications of choices
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Advocate for consistency where it matters

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Made architectural decision with multi-product impact
- [ ] Decision from 1+ years ago still proving sound
- [ ] Created architectural standard adopted broadly
- [ ] Resolved architectural disagreement with good outcome

### 3. Organizational Influence

Master Builders influence through expertise and credibility, not authority.

**Activities:**
- Share expertise in ways that educate others
- Build reputation as trusted advisor
- Navigate organizational dynamics productively
- Advocate for technical direction effectively

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Other Builders seek your advice proactively
- [ ] Your technical recommendations are followed
- [ ] Influenced organizational decision through expertise
- [ ] Built coalition around technical direction

### 4. Systemic AI Evaluation

Master Builders evaluate AI at a systemic level, catching patterns others miss.

**Activities:**
- Develop patterns for AI evaluation across projects
- Identify when AI tools are creating systematic problems
- Set standards for AI usage organization-wide
- Stay current with AI tool evolution

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Identified systemic AI issue across multiple projects
- [ ] Created AI usage standard adopted by team
- [ ] Caught subtle AI failure pattern others missed
- [ ] Evaluated and introduced new AI tools effectively

### 5. Filling Capability Gaps

Most Builders have 1-2 capabilities at Developing (2). Master Builders must close these gaps.

**For each gap area:**
- Identify specific sub-capabilities that are weak
- Create deliberate practice opportunities
- Seek feedback specifically on gap areas
- Track improvement over time

## Progression Indicators

### Ready for Master Builder Assessment

**Strong signals:**
- Successfully developed Apprentice(s) to Builder level
- Architectural decisions that proved sound over time
- Strong (3) in all six capabilities
- Other Builders treat you as authority
- Influence technical direction without formal authority

### Not ready (yet)

**Warning signals:**
- Haven't developed others successfully
- Capability gaps persist
- Architectural decisions have needed revision
- Influence comes from position, not expertise
- Prefer building to developing others

### May not be Master Builder trajectory

**Consider if:**
- Prefer hands-on building over developing others
- Don't want organizational scope
- Strong in 4 capabilities but don't want to develop others
- Exploration focus (doesn't naturally lead to Master Builder)

**This is OK.** Builder is a valid career destination.

## Development Activities by Gap Area

### If Product Judgment needs development:

- Lead product discussions, not just participate
- Make product decisions without PM guidance
- Connect with users directly and regularly
- Propose product direction, not just features

### If Design Judgment needs development:

- Build without design support as exercise
- Lead design critiques
- Study UX patterns systematically
- Get feedback specifically on design decisions

### If Commercial Awareness needs development:

- Sit with business stakeholders regularly
- Track business metrics for your products
- Make explicit ROI calculations for technical decisions
- Present to executives with business framing

### If System Thinking needs development:

- Own cross-system issues
- Document system interactions comprehensively
- Lead root cause analysis for complex issues
- Anticipate impacts and verify predictions

## For Current Master Builders

### Supporting Builder Development

Your role in developing future Master Builders:
- Identify Builders with Master Builder potential
- Create opportunities for architectural ownership
- Support their Apprentice development work
- Provide feedback on gaps
- Advocate for progression when ready

### What to look for:

- Does this Builder naturally develop others?
- Do other Builders seek their input?
- Are they closing capability gaps?
- Do they think at organizational scale?
- Would I trust them with architectural decisions?

## Assessment Process

When ready for progression:

1. Builder self-assessment using rubric
2. Current Master Builder assessment (if available)
3. Review of Builder development track record
4. Review of architectural decisions and outcomes
5. CTO/VP Engineering review
6. Progression decision

See [Master Builder Readiness Assessment](../assessment/Master_Builder_Readiness_Assessment.md) for detailed criteria.
