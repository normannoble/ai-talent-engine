## Level Summaries

### Apprentice

**Duration:** 12-24 months typically

**Focus:** Learning all six capabilities under Builder guidance

**Success looks like:**
- Rapid capability growth
- Increasing autonomy
- Quality work with decreasing oversight
- Proactive learning behavior

**Exit criteria:** Strong (3) in 3-4 capabilities, no Weak (1) areas, demonstrated autonomous delivery

---

### Builder

**Duration:** Career-level role (many will stay here)

**Focus:** Autonomous product delivery with Apprentice development

**Two variants:**
- **Delivery Builder** — Shipping products, developing Apprentices
- **Exploration Builder** — Blue sky work, rapid prototyping

**Success looks like:**
- Complete products shipped
- Apprentices developed
- Sound judgment across most capabilities
- Reliable, autonomous delivery

**Exit criteria for Master Builder:** Development of Apprentices into Builders, architectural ownership, Strong (3) in 5-6 capabilities

---

### Master Builder

**Duration:** Career-level role

**Focus:** Architectural coherence, Builder development, highest-stakes decisions

**Success looks like:**
- Builders who become strong because of your development
- Architecture that scales and evolves well
- Organization that ships more with less
- Technical direction trusted and followed

---

## Career Decisions

### Staying vs. Progressing

**Builder is a valid career destination.** Not everyone needs to become a Master Builder.

Good reasons to stay as Builder:
- Enjoy hands-on building more than developing others
- Prefer product focus over organizational scope
- Strong in 4 capabilities but don't want to develop the others further
- Exploration focus (doesn't lead to Master Builder naturally)

Indicators for Master Builder trajectory:
- Strong in all six capabilities
- Natural tendency to develop others
- Interested in architectural decisions across products
- Comfortable with organizational influence

### Delivery vs. Exploration

Builders can move between Delivery and Exploration:

| If you prefer... | Consider... |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Shipping products, seeing work in production | Delivery Builder |
| Speed, experimentation, throwing things away | Exploration Builder |
| Developing Apprentices | Delivery Builder |
| Working solo at high velocity | Exploration Builder |

## Development Guidance

### Apprentice → Builder

**Timeline:** 12-24 months

**Key development areas:**
1. Build autonomous delivery capability
2. Develop judgment in all six areas
3. Learn to evaluate AI output critically
4. Build portfolio of end-to-end work

**How your Builder mentor helps:**
- Assigns progressively challenging work
- Provides feedback on all six capabilities
- Creates space for autonomous work
- Advocates for promotion when ready

### Builder → Master Builder

**Timeline:** 3-5+ years

**Key development areas:**
1. Develop Apprentices successfully
2. Own architectural decisions across products
3. Strengthen any capability gaps to Strong (3)
4. Build organizational influence

**How to accelerate:**
- Seek out Apprentice development opportunities
- Take on cross-product architectural decisions
- Deliberately develop weaker capabilities
- Build reputation as trusted authority

## Compensation Philosophy

### General Principles

- Compensation reflects capability level, not tenure
- Builder model roles command premium (scarcity + leverage)
- Progression brings meaningful compensation increases
- Market rate for generalists with proven breadth

### Level Expectations

| Level | Market Positioning |
|-------|-------------------|
| Apprentice | Junior-Mid Engineer equivalent |
| Builder | Senior-Staff Engineer equivalent |
| Master Builder | Staff-Principal Engineer or Director equivalent |

---

## Alternative Paths

### Into the Builder Model

- Traditional engineers can transition with capability development
- Designers/PMs with technical ability can enter as Apprentices
- Entrepreneurs often have the breadth profile already

### Out of the Builder Model

- Builders can move to traditional senior engineering roles
- Master Builders can move to Director/VP Engineering
- Exploration Builders can move to product/strategy roles

The Builder model develops transferable skills—breadth is valuable everywhere.
